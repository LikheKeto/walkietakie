# WalkieTalkie
## How it works?
- Clients communicate with a server to create connection with another client through webSockets.
- A webRTC connection is made between two clients once they are in same frequency
- Then peer-to-peer connection takes over and the central server is no more needed

### TODO
Currently only two clients can communicate, expand it so more can be in same frequency.
